a fistfight atop a tower.
a daring rescue preceding a giant explosion.
a heroic sacrifice that on one will ever remember.
a philosophical argument punctuated by violence.
a false victory with the promise of future danger.
the invocation of a spell at the last possible moment.
eternal love professed without irony.
the land restored to health.
authorial preaching through the mouths of the characters.
convoluted nonsense that sanders the readersâ€™ goodwill.
wish-fulfillment solutions to real-world problems.
a cliffhanger for the sake of prompting a series.
